Remote vanilla PDB (over TCP sockets) *done right*: no extras, proper handling around connection failures and CI. Based
on `pdbx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdbx>`_.

* Free software: BSD 2-Clause License

Installation
============

::

    pip install remote-pdb

Usage
=====

To open a remote PDB on first available port:

.. code:: python

    from remote_pdb import set_trace
    set_trace() # you'll see the port number in the logs

To use some specific host/port:

.. code:: python

    from remote_pdb import RemotePdb
    RemotePdb('127.0.0.1', 4444).set_trace()

To connect just run ``telnet 127.0.0.1 4444``.  When you are finished
debugging, either exit the debugger, or press Control-], then Control-d.

Alternately, one can connect with NetCat: ``nc -C 127.0.0.1 4444`` or Socat: ``socat readline
tcp:127.0.0.1:4444`` (for line editing and history support).  When finished debugging, either exit
the debugger, or press Control-c.

Integration with breakpoint() in Python 3.7+
============================================

If you are using Python 3.7 one can use the new ``breakpoint()`` built in to invoke
remote PDB. In this case the following environment variable must be set:

.. code:: bash

    PYTHONBREAKPOINT=remote_pdb.set_trace

The debugger can then be invoked as follows, without any imports:

.. code:: python

    breakpoint()

As the ``breakpoint()`` function does not take any arguments, environment variables can be used to
specify the host and port that the server should listen to. For example, to run ``script.py`` in such a
way as to make ``telnet 127.0.0.1 4444`` the correct way of connecting, one would run:

.. code:: bash

    PYTHONBREAKPOINT=remote_pdb.set_trace REMOTE_PDB_HOST=127.0.0.1 REMOTE_PDB_PORT=4444 python script.py

If ``REMOTE_PDB_HOST`` is omitted then a default value of 127.0.0.1 will be used. If ``REMOTE_PDB_PORT`` is
omitted then the first available port will be used. The connection information will be logged to the console,
as with calls to ``remote_pdb.set_trace()``.

To quiet the output, set ``REMOTE_PDB_QUIET=1``, this will prevent
``RemotePdb`` from producing any output -- you'll probably want to specify
``REMOTE_PDB_PORT`` as well since the randomized port won't be printed.


Note about OS X
===============

In certain scenarios (backgrounded processes) OS X will prevent readline to be imported (and readline is a dependency of pdb). 
A workaround (run this early):

.. code:: python

    import signal
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTTOU, signal.SIG_IGN)

See `#9 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-remote-pdb/issues/9>`_ and `cpython#14892 <http://bugs.python.org/issue14892>`_.

Requirements
============

Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and PyPy are supported.

Changelog
=========

2.0.0 (2019-07-31)
------------------

* Fixed inconsistency with normal use of ``pdb`` - `BdbQuit` will now be raised on quitting.
  Contributed by Anthony Sottile in `#18 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-remote-pdb/pull/18>`_.
  **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE**.
* Added ``REMOTE_PDB_QUIET=1`` to silence output.
  Contributed by Anthony Sottile in `#19 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-remote-pdb/pull/19>`_.

1.3.0 (2019-03-13)
------------------

* Documented support for Python 3.7's ``breakpoint()``.
* Added support for setting the socket listening host/port through the ``REMOTE_PDB_HOST``/``REMOTE_PDB_PORT``
  environment variables. Contributed by Matthew Wilkes in `#14 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-remote-pdb/pull/14>`_.
* Removed use of `rw` file wrappers around sockets (turns out socket's ``makefile`` is very buggy in Python 3.6 and
  later - `output is discarded <https://bugs.python.org/issue35928>`_). Contributed in `#13
  <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-remote-pdb/pull/13>`_.

1.2.0 (2015-09-26)
------------------
